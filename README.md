# Sprint Review and Retrospective

## **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
Understanding user needs requires clear communication and well-defined **user stories**. In this project, user stories helped break down requirements into manageable, actionable tasks. By defining **acceptance criteria, user value statements, and expected outcomes**, the team ensured the final product aligned with stakeholder expectations. Agile’s iterative approach allowed for continuous refinement, ensuring features met user needs effectively.

## **How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
My approach to development follows an **Agile mindset**, prioritizing **incremental progress, flexibility, and continuous feedback**. Throughout this project, **sprint planning, backlog refinement, and daily standups** played a key role in improving efficiency. In the future, I plan to incorporate:
- **User story-driven development** for better requirement clarity.
- **Frequent sprint reviews** to ensure continuous improvement.
- **JIRA or similar tools** for backlog tracking and sprint management.

## **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
A good team member actively **communicates, collaborates, and adapts** to challenges. In this project, effective teamwork was evident in:
- **Daily standups**, keeping everyone aligned.
- **Backlog refinement meetings**, ensuring clear priorities.
- **Collaboration between developers, testers, and product owners**, resulting in high-quality deliverables.

By embracing Agile principles and fostering **open communication**, team members contribute to a **more efficient and productive development process**.
